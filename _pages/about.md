I am a fourth year undergraduate at IIT Delhi, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and pursuing minor in Economics. In my second year, I did a research intern at The Ohio State University, Columbus, and I interned with the cost engineering department, Daimler, Kawasaki in my third year. I have previously worked as a CSR intern at Power Grid. I also am a student volunteer with Jean Dreze since November 2019.
I am a persistent worker with a penchant for solving problems, and I have always gravitated towards the mathematical sciences for their ubiquity and my innate fondness for the intellectual challenge they pose. During the course of my degree, I pursued several projects and you may find more details about the same on my page.

I have always enjoyed reading books and find solace in them whenever I have idle time (or not) or mental blocks. As a flimsy appendix to my passion for reading, I like writing, and you'll find more of that on my page too.
Other than this, I am into quizzing, basketball, and I have a Senior diploma with over eight years of training in Kathak, an Indian classical dance form.
