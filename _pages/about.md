Since August 2020, I work at American Express as a Risk Management Analyst with the Corporate Credit Abuse and Credit Bust Out team, ideating, formulating and implementing strategies and decisions for the US and Global markets.
I graduated from IIT Delhi, majoring in Mechanical Engineering and pursuing minor in Economics in 2020. In my second year, I did a research intern at The Ohio State University, Columbus, and I interned with the cost engineering department as a Summer Analyst at Daimler, Kawasaki in my third year. I have previously worked as a CSR intern at Power Grid. I also am a student volunteer with Jean Dreze since November 2019.
I am a persistent worker with a penchant for solving problems, and I have always gravitated towards the mathematical sciences for their ubiquity and my innate fondness for the intellectual challenge they pose. During the course of my degree, I pursued several projects and you may find more details about the same on my page.
I am an avid reader, open to recommendations and discussions about anything under the Sun :D
Other than this, I like quizzing, basketball, and I have a Senior diploma with over eight years of training in Kathak, an Indian classical dance form. A line of my creative pusuits can be found at instagram.com/syrup.n.spice.
